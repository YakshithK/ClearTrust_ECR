1. Never share your personal information (like bank details or passwords) over the phone or email unless you are sure of the recipient's identity.
2. Be cautious of urgent requests for money, especially if they pressure you to act quickly.
3. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
4. Do not click on suspicious links in emails or text messages.
5. Always verify the identity of the caller or sender by contacting the organization directly using official contact details.
6. Report any suspicious messages or calls to a trusted family member or authority.
